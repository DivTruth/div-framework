Site Name: Div Framework
Stylesheet: Grid Stylesheet

I've seperated the grid so you can swap it out easily. It's
called at the top the style.scss stylesheet.

There are a ton of grid solutions out there. You should definitely
experiment with your own. Here are some recommendations:

http://gridsetapp.com - Love this site. Responsive Grids made easy.
http://susy.oddbird.net/ - Grids using Compass. Very elegant.
http://gridpak.com/ - Create your own responsive grid.

The grid below is a combination of the 1140 grid and Twitter Boostrap. 
I liked 1140 but Boostrap's grid was way more detailed so I merged them 
together, let's see how this works out. If you want to use 1140, the original 
values are commented out on each line.

EXAMPLE:
	@include twelvecol();

	//if not in a media query directive then setfor @extends
	@include twelvecol;
