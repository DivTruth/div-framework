Div Framework
===================

A solid, bones-like, SASS framework with an emphasis on a mobile first approach. One of the few frameworks that aims to maintain the WordPress philosophy that themes are responsible for appearance while plugins maintain the functionality. For this reason Div Starter is a plugin that was developed to help maintain this integrity throughout the development process without sacrificing freedom of creative solution for developers
